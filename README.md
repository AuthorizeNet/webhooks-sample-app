## Database File 

By default a database file to store recent notifications is created at /db/notification.db. Initially the live event chart is not displayed, notification log in UI does not contain any recent notifications and also empty charts are displayed in dashboard tab of the application since the server is just started and database is empty. When the server begins to receive notifications, charts and notification logs are updated. 

## UI 

1. Two tabs namely "Live Event Monitoring" and "Dashboard" are present. 
2. First tab shows the Live Event chart at the top and live notification monitor at the bottom. A dropdown is present to filter the notifications by event type. 
3. Second tab contains charts of Payment amount, Refund amount, number of Customers created and number of fraud transactions held in last few days.
